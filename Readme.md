# Migration
This is a game created with Unreal Engine 4 to challenge your selective attention. You have to identify where the lead bird in a flock is headed, ignoring the distractors around it.

> **Selective attention** refers to the processes that allow an individual to select and focus on particular input for further processing while simultaneously suppressing irrelevant or distracting information.
